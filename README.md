# TAQ Project

## Installation
You can create a new Python environment and install the required packages using the following command:  

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Python version: 3.10

## Usage
All **implementation** files are in the corresponding folder in the _src_ folder.
```
src
  -- prepare_taq_data
  -- compute_summary_stats
  -- analyze_autocorrelation
  -- mean_variance_optimization
```
The prepare_taq_data, compute_summary_stats, analyze_autocorrelation, and mean_variance_optimization folders contain code for Question1, 2, 3, 4, respectively. 

All **unit test** files are in _unit_test_ folder. The _unit_test_ folder has a same structure as the _src_ folder. The unit tests are stored in the corresponding folder.


Change **MyDirectories.py** in src folder first, then **run** corresponding unit test file to run the project.

## Output
Check the output folder.
